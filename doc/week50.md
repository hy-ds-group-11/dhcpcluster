Today we got the server to react to client requests in a reasonable manner,
e.g. find and refresh, or create a new lease, and then reply to the client.

Some bugs had to be ironed out (also in the client), but the project is ready
to be demoed next wednesday!

There is a laundry list of stuff that can still be polished (currently only in
our Discord), and those should probably be converted to GitHub issues and
resolved eventually.

We got the server to run on three separate nodes over the Internet.
It wasn't trivial, there were (and are) still some bugs in the server code.

Regardless, this is a milestone achievement for the project, and fulfillment of
course grading criteria as well.

A demo video was recorded, which can be viewed in the [README](../README.md).

Remaining bugs and improvement ideas were documented in [Issues](https://github.com/hy-ds-group-11/dhcpcluster/issues).
