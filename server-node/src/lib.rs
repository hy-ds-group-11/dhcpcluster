//! # DHCP Cluster - Server Implementation
//!
//! This crate contains a distributed DHCP server implementation, with a custom protocol between nodes.
//!
//! For the protocol definition, look into the [`message`] module.
//!
//! The server architecture comprises of threads, which use blocking operations to communicate over [`TcpStream`]s.
//! There are two threads per active peer, one for receiving messages and one for sending messages.
//! There is also a server logic thread, handling bookkeeping for the peer- and client events.
//!
//! For the communication thread implementation, look into the [`peer`] module.
