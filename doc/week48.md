The test harness is pretty much feature-complete now, with both `TcpStream` and
`TcpListener` mocked and repository test coverage at over 90% at the moment.
There is about 30% greater quantity of lines of test code than actual server
implementation, and the team needs to get all members introduced to the test
harness so that development can continue as a team effort.
The next session has been scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.
